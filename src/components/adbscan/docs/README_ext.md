# ADBSCAN Follow-me

ADBSCAN (Adaptive Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is an Intel® patented unsupervised clustering algorithm designed for robust spatial object detection and localization from 2D LiDAR, 3D LiDAR, and Intel® RealSense™ depth camera point clouds.

Unlike traditional DBSCAN—which relies on static neighborhood search radii ($\epsilon$) and fixed density thresholds ($MinPts$)—ADBSCAN dynamically scales these parameters based on range from the sensor and the field-of-view point distribution. This compensates for optical beam divergence and spatial point cloud sparsity at extended distances, yielding a 20–30% increase in effective object detection range.

The Follow-Me reference application builds on ADBSCAN to continuously track a target human or guide vehicle, evaluate multi-modal interaction cues (hand gestures and voice commands via Intel® OpenVINO™), and command mobile base velocities.

## Architecture & Algorithm

### ADBSCAN Algorithmic Foundation

In LiDAR and structured-light depth sensing, point density decreases non-linearly with distance $r$. Standard spatial clustering with a fixed radius $\epsilon$ causes over-segmentation at close range and cluster fragmentation or omission at distant ranges.

ADBSCAN formulates adaptive clustering parameters:

1. **Dynamic Radius $\epsilon(r)$**: Expands monotonically with range to encapsulate sparsely distributed returns from distant objects.
2. **Dynamic Density $MinPts(r)$**: Scaled using calibration coefficients (`base`, `coeff_1`, `coeff_2`, `scale_factor`) to match expected return point distributions at given range slices.
3. **Hardware Acceleration**: The neighbor search phase can optionally be offloaded to integrated or discrete GPUs via Intel® oneAPI™ SYCL kernels (`oneapi_kdtree` or `oneapi_octree`), delivering substantial latency reductions on dense point clouds.

## Intel®-Optimized ADBSCAN

In this version of ADBSCAN, the algorithm has been optimized for Intel® SOC by
replacing linear neighbor point search with an optimized oneAPI PCL library
(offloaded to GPU), as well as refactoring the clustering algorithm. This
tutorial describes how to run this Intel-optimized ADBSCAN algorithm and compare
the execution time with the unoptimized version.

### ADBSCAN Optimization Setup

The Intel-optimized and unoptimized versions of the algorithm are distributed
as `ros-jazzy-adbscan-oneapi` and `ros-jazzy-adbscan-ros2`, respectively.
We demonstrate the gain in latency for a ROS 2 bag file with point cloud data
from a RealSense camera. The amount of gain is prominent when the input
is dense or the number of input points is large. In case of a 2D LIDAR,
the point cloud is comparatively sparse and hence, not showed here.

### ADBSCAN Optimization Prerequisites

Complete the [Getting Started](../../platform_foundation/getting_started.md) guide before continuing.

### Install and run the ROS 2 bag file Deb package

Install the following package with ROS 2 bag files in order to publish point
cloud data from LIDAR and RealSense camera:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} **Jazzy**
:sync: jazzy

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-bagfile-laser-pointcloud
```

:::
:::{tab-item}  **Humble**
:sync: humble

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-bagfile-laser-pointcloud
```

:::
::::

Run the following commands in a terminal:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} **Jazzy**
:sync: jazzy

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 bag play --loop /opt/ros/jazzy/share/bagfiles/laser-pointcloud
```

:::
:::{tab-item}  **Humble**
:sync: humble

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 bag play --loop /opt/ros/humble/share/bagfiles/laser-pointcloud
```

:::
::::

This command will launch the ROS 2 bag file and publish the recorded point
cloud data to respective topics. You will view the following screen output:

![rosbag_play_screen](images/rosbag_play_screen.png)

`ros2 topic list` command will show a list of the published topics which
include `/scan` (point cloud from 2D LIDAR) and `/camera/depth/color/points`
(point cloud from RealSense camera).

### Install and run optimized Deb package

Install `ros-jazzy-adbscan-oneapi` Deb package from Intel® Autonomous Mobile
Robot APT repository:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} **Jazzy**
:sync: jazzy

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-adbscan-oneapi
```

:::
:::{tab-item}  **Humble**
:sync: humble

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-adbscan-oneapi
```

:::
::::

Run the following command in a terminal:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} **Jazzy**
:sync: jazzy

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run adbscan_ros2 adbscan_sub --ros-args --params-file /opt/ros/jazzy/share/adbscan_ros2/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml
```

:::
:::{tab-item}  **Humble**
:sync: humble

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run adbscan_ros2 adbscan_sub --ros-args --params-file /opt/ros/humble/share/adbscan_ros2/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml
```

:::
::::

This will print tables with the benchmarking data as showed below:

![benchmarking_picture_adbscan](images/benchmarking_picture_adbscan.png)

The table shows a breakdown between pre-processing, ADBSCAN execution and
post-processing time. The caption at the bottom of the table will print
which PCL library is being used.

### Install and run standard (unoptimized) Deb package

Install `ros-jazzy-adbscan-ros2` Deb package from Intel® Autonomous Mobile
Robot APT repository

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} **Jazzy**
:sync: jazzy

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-adbscan-ros2
```

:::
:::{tab-item}  **Humble**
:sync: humble

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-adbscan-ros2
```

:::
::::

Run the following command in a terminal

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} **Jazzy**
:sync: jazzy

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run adbscan_ros2 adbscan_sub --ros-args --params-file /opt/ros/jazzy/share/adbscan_ros2/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml
```

:::
:::{tab-item}  **Humble**
:sync: humble

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run adbscan_ros2 adbscan_sub --ros-args --params-file /opt/ros/humble/share/adbscan_ros2/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml
```

:::
::::

This will print a similar table with the benchmarking data.

![benchmark_table_unoptimized](images/benchmark_table_unoptimized.png)

You will see that the ADBSCAN execution time is much smaller for the optimized
version compared to the standard one. The pre-processing and post-processing time
should be more or less of the same range in both versions, since the input bag
file is identical. The amount of gain in execution time will depend on the
system configuration, the size of the point cloud data in the input frames etc.

### Re-configurable parameters

The optimized ADBSCAN has a user-defined parameter called `oneapi_library` to
choose from a set of PCL libraries: `oneapi_kdtree`, `oneapi_octree`,
`pcl_kdtree`. The default value is `oneapi_kdtree`.
Moreover, one can run both optimized and unoptimized packages with a parameter
called `benchmark_number_of_frames`. It will take an integer (greater or equal
to 1) as input and the benchmarking table will produce the average execution
time of `benchmark_number_of_frames` frames, instead of a single frame
(default value).

For example, you can use the following command to run the optimized ADBSCAN
with `oneapi_octree` library and display the benchmarking data for
an average of 5 frames:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} **Jazzy**
:sync: jazzy

```bash
ros2 run adbscan_ros2 adbscan_sub --ros-args --params-file /opt/ros/jazzy/share/adbscan_ros2/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml  -p benchmark_number_of_frames:=5 -p oneapi_library:=oneapi_octree
```

:::
:::{tab-item}  **Humble**
:sync: humble

```bash
ros2 run adbscan_ros2 adbscan_sub --ros-args --params-file /opt/ros/humble/share/adbscan_ros2/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml  -p benchmark_number_of_frames:=5 -p oneapi_library:=oneapi_octree
```

:::
::::

A complete list of the reconfigurable parameters is given below:

- `Lidar_type`

  Type of the point cloud sensor. For RealSense camera and LIDAR inputs,
  the default value is set to `RS` and `2D`, respectively.

- `Lidar_topic`

  Name of the topic publishing point cloud data.

- `Verbose`

  If this flag is set to `True`, the locations of the detected target objects
  will be printed as the screen log.

- `subsample_ratio`

  This is the downsampling rate of the original point cloud data. Default value
  = 15 (i.e., every 15-th data in the original point cloud is sampled and passed
  to the core ADBSCAN algorithm).

- `x_filter_back`

  Point cloud data with x-coordinate `x_filter_back` are filtered out (positive
  x direction lies in front of the robot).

- `y_filter_left`, `y_filter_right`

  Point cloud data with y-coordinate `y_filter_left` and `y-coordinate` \<
  `y_filter_right` are filtered out (positive `y-direction` is to the left of
  robot and vice versa)

- `z_filter`

  Point cloud data with z-coordinate \< `z_filter` will be filtered out.
  This option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- `Z_based_ground_removal`

  Filtering in the z-direction will be applied only if this value is non-zero.
  This option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- `base`, `coeff_1`, `coeff_2`, `scale_factor`

  These are the coefficients used to calculate the adaptive parameters of the
  ADBSCAN algorithm. These values are pre-computed and recommended to keep unchanged.

- `oneapi_library`

  Available options are: `oneapi_kdtree`, `oneapi_octree`, `pcl_kdtree`.
  `oneapi_kdtree` and `oneapi_octree` allow the algorithm to use optimized
  oneAPI™ KdTree or octree library and offload the neighbor point search method
  to GPU. `pcl_kdtree` option uses the standard PCL KdTree library,
  not optimized for Intel® SOC.

- `benchmark_number_of_frames`

  Any integer greater or equal to 1. This is the number of frames over which
  the average execution time is executed and printed in the benchmarking table.

### ADBSCAN Optimization Troubleshooting

- Failed to install Deb package: Please make sure to run `sudo apt update`
  before installing the necessary Deb packages.

- You can stop the demo anytime by pressing `ctrl-C`.

- The screen log will show `number of points after subsampling` and
  `number of points after filtering`. If these values are zero, please make
  sure to adjust the following parameters to make sure these values are
  greater than zero.

  - Decrease `subsample_ratio`.
  - Increase the absolute values of `x_filter_back`, `y_filter_right`,
    `y_filter_left`.

    Please see the description of these parameters in the table and adjust
    according to your environment.

- IA-optimized ADBSCAN offloads the neighbor search to GPUs when using
  `oneapi_kdtree` and `oneapi_octree` library.

  Please make sure that your system is equipped with working gpu, if using
  these libraries. You can use `lspci` command in a Linux terminal to
  view GPU info.

- `ros-jazzy-adbscan-ros2` and `ros-jazzy-adbscan-oneapi` are mutually
  exclusive Deb packages.

  Please refrain from installing them simultaneously
  like this `apt install ros-jazzy-adbscan-ros2 ros-jazzy-adbscan-oneapi`.
  Always install the packages sequentially, as showed in this document.

- You may experience lower performance if the Linux kernel schedules the `adbscan_ros2`
process to an efficient-core (E-core). To achieve better performance, you can
utilize the `taskset` command to set the process's CPU affinity. For example,
you can direct `adbscan_ros2` to run on CPU core 0 which is
a performance-core (P-core).

In this demo, RealSense camera of the TurtleBot3 robot is selected as
the input point cloud sensor. After running all of the above commands,
you will observe similar behavior of the TurtleBot3 robot and guide robot in the
`Gazebo` GUI as in [Run Demo with 2D Lidar](#run-demo-with-2d-lidar).

There are reconfigurable parameters in
`/opt/ros/humble/share/adbscan_ros2_follow_me/config/` directory for both LIDAR
(`adbscan_sub_2D.yaml`) and RealSense camera (`adbscan_sub_RS.yaml`).

The user can modify parameters depending on the respective robot, sensor
configuration and environments (if required) before running the tutorial.
Find a brief description of the parameters in the following list:

- ``Lidar_type``

  Type of the point cloud sensor. For RealSense camera and LIDAR inputs,
  the default value is set to ``RS`` and ``2D``, respectively.

- ``Lidar_topic``

  Name of the topic publishing point cloud data.

- ``Verbose``

  If this flag is set to ``True``, the locations of the detected target objects
  will be printed as the screen log.

- ``subsample_ratio``

  This is the downsampling rate of the original point cloud data. Default value
  = 15 (i.e. every 15-th data in the original point cloud is sampled and passed
  to the core ADBSCAN algorithm).

- ``x_filter_back``

  Point cloud data with x-coordinate > ``x_filter_back`` are filtered out
  (positive x direction lies in front of the robot).

- ``y_filter_left``, ``y_filter_right``

  Point cloud data with y-coordinate > ``y_filter_left`` and y-coordinate <
  ``y_filter_right`` are filtered out (positive y-direction is to the left of
  robot and vice versa).

- ``z_filter``

  Point cloud data with z-coordinate < ``z_filter`` will be filtered out. This
  option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- ``Z_based_ground_removal``

  Filtering in the z-direction will be applied only if this value is non-zero.
  This option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- ``base``, ``coeff_1``, ``coeff_2``, ``scale_factor``

  These are the coefficients used to calculate adaptive parameters of the
  ADBSCAN algorithm. These values are pre-computed and recommended
  to keep unchanged.

- ``init_tgt_loc``

  This value describes the initial target location. The person needs to be at a
  distance of ``init_tgt_loc`` in front of the robot to initiate the motor.

- ``max_dist``

  This is the maximum distance that the robot can follow. If the person moves at
  a distance > ``max_dist``, the robot will stop following.

- ``min_dist``

  This value describes the safe distance the robot will always maintain with the
  target person. If the person moves closer than ``min_dist``,
  the robot stops following.

- ``max_linear``

  Maximum linear velocity of the robot.

- ``max_angular``

  Maximum angular velocity of the robot.

- ``max_frame_blocked``

  The robot will keep following the target for ``max_frame_blocked`` number of
  frames in the event of a temporary occlusion.

- ``tracking_radius``

  The robot will keep following the target as long as the current target
  location = previous location +/- ``tracking_radius``

### Simulation Troubleshooting

- Failed to install Deb package: Please make sure to run `sudo apt update`
  before installing the necessary Deb packages.

- You can stop the demo anytime by pressing `ctrl-C`. If the `Gazebo` simulator
  freezes or does not stop, please use the following commands in a terminal:

## Deploy Follow-me on a Physical Mobile Robot (Clearpath Jackal / AAEON AMR)

This section provides instructions for running the ADBSCAN-based Follow-me
pipeline on physical Autonomous Mobile Robots using RealSense depth camera or
LiDAR inputs.

The sensor publishes point clouds to `/camera/depth/color/points` (RealSense)
or laser scans to `/scan` (LiDAR). The `adbscan_sub_node` or `adbscan_sub_w_gesture_audio`
subscribes to the corresponding topic, segments clusters using range-adaptive
parameters, determines the target person's centroid, computes linear and angular
velocity adjustments, and publishes differential-drive commands to `/cmd_vel` of
type `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`. This message is subsequently consumed by the
chassis base controller.

### Deployment Setup

#### Deployment Prerequisites

`/opt/ros/<distro>/share/adbscan_ros2_follow_me/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml` (or `src/adbscan_ros2_follow_me/config/adbscan_sub_RS.yaml` when developing locally).
Find a brief description of the parameters in the following list:

- ``Lidar_type``

  Type of the point cloud sensor. For RealSense camera and LIDAR inputs,
  the default value is set to ``RS`` and ``2D``, respectively.

- ``Lidar_topic``

  Name of the topic publishing point cloud data.

- ``Verbose``

  If this flag is set to ``True``, the locations of the detected target objects
  will be printed as the screen log.

- ``subsample_ratio``

  This is the downsampling rate of the original point cloud data. Default value
  = 15 (i.e. every 15-th data in the original point cloud is sampled and passed
  to the core BSCAN algorithm).

- ``x_filter_back``

  Point cloud data with x-coordinate > ``x_filter_back`` are filtered out
  (positive x direction lies in front of the robot).

- ``y_filter_left``, ``y_filter_right``

  Point cloud data with y-coordinate > ``y_filter_left`` and y-coordinate <
  ``y_filter_right`` are filtered out (positive y-direction is to the left of
  robot and vice versa).

- ``z_filter``

  Point cloud data with z-coordinate < ``z_filter`` will be filtered out. This
  option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- ``Z_based_ground_removal``

  Filtering in the z-direction will be applied only if this value is non-zero.
  This option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- ``base``, ``coeff_1``, ``coeff_2``, ``scale_factor``

  These are the coefficients used to calculate adaptive parameters of the
  ADBSCAN algorithm. These values are pre-computed and recommended
  to keep unchanged.

- ``init_tgt_loc``

  This value describes the initial target location. The person needs to be at a
  distance of ``init_tgt_loc`` in front of the robot to initiate the motor.

- ``max_dist``

  This is the maximum distance that the robot can follow. If the person moves
  at a distance > ``max_dist``, the robot will stop following.

- ``min_dist``

  This value describes the safe distance the robot will always maintain with
  the target person. If the person moves closer than ``min_dist``,
  the robot stops following.

- ``max_linear``

  Maximum linear velocity of the robot.

- ``max_angular``

  Maximum angular velocity of the robot.

- ``max_frame_blocked``

  The robot will keep following the target for ``max_frame_blocked`` number of
  frames in the event of a temporary occlusion.

- ``tracking_radius``

  The robot will keep following the target as long as the current target
  location = previous location +/- ``tracking_radius``

### Deployment Troubleshooting

- Failed to install Deb package: Please make sure to run `sudo apt update`
  before installing the necessary Deb packages.
- You may stop the demo anytime by pressing `ctrl-C`.
- If the robot rotates more than intended at each step, try reducing the
  parameter `max_angular` in the parameter file.
- If the motor controller board does not start, restart the robot.
- For general robot issues, refer to
  the [troubleshooting guide](../../resources/troubleshooting).
