# FastMapping

FastMapping is an optimized ROS 2 package for real-time 3D volumetric occupancy mapping from RGB-D camera streams, providing lower latency and reduced memory footprint compared to standard OctoMap implementations.

For extended documentation, architecture details, and tutorials, refer to the [Robotics AI Suite FastMapping Guide](https://developer.robotics.intel.com/development-stack/components/optimized_solutions/run-fastmapping-algorithm/).

---

## Overview and Architecture

### Key Features

- **High-Performance 3D Octree**: Built upon an optimized volumetric mapping engine (`fast_mapping_lib`) leveraging Morton code spatial indexing and B-spline depth fusion for fast voxel allocation and updates.
- **2D Planar Map Projection**: Automatically slices and projects 3D obstacles between configurable height bounds (`projection_min_z` to `projection_max_z`) directly into standard `nav_msgs/msg/OccupancyGrid` messages for Nav2 costmaps.
- **Multi-Camera Synchronization**: Synchronizes up to four depth cameras simultaneously using approximate-time message filtering.
- **Dynamic Free-Space Clearing**: Depth measurements update and clear observed free space dynamically, accounting for configured robot footprint clearance (`robot_radius`).
- **Flexible SLAM & Odometry Integration**: Resolves camera poses asynchronously through the ROS 2 TF tree with user-configurable transformation delay tolerance.

### Architectural Comparison: FastMapping vs. Standard OctoMap

Standard OctoMap (`octomap_mapping` / `octovis`) has long been the default 3D volumetric mapping representation in robotics, but encounters computational and memory bottlenecks when handling high-frame-rate depth camera streams on compute-constrained platforms. FastMapping replaces the standard OctoMap backend with the **Supereight** volumetric engine and introduces algorithmic optimizations across memory layout, ray integration, and occupancy probability modeling:

| Metric / Dimension | Standard OctoMap (`octomap` / `octomap_server`) | FastMapping (`fast_mapping`) | Architectural Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Octree Indexing** | Pointer-chasing tree traversal: each node allocates 8 pointer references to child nodes. | **Morton Code (Z-order Curve)** spatial hashing. Keyed spatial addresses map 3D voxel coordinates directly to tree levels with bitwise operations. | Eliminates pointer dereferencing overhead; achieves $O(1)$ block lookups and superior CPU cache locality. |
| **Memory Allocation** | Fine-grained, dynamic heap allocations (`new`/`delete`) per individual octree node or leaf. | **Pre-allocated Chunked Memory Pools** (`MemoryPool<VoxelBlock>`, `MemoryPool<Node>`). Allocates contiguous 8x8x8 voxel blocks. | Drastically mitigates heap fragmentation and allocation latency during dynamic map expansion. |
| **Depth Ray Integration** | **Bresenham 3D Ray-Casting**: casts discrete rays per depth pixel from the camera origin through every intermediate voxel cell. | **Projective Forward Mapping**: projects active voxel blocks into the camera image plane via camera intrinsics ($K$), checking only blocks within the camera frustum. | Reduces ray computation complexity from $O(N_{rays} \cdot N_{steps})$ to operations proportional to visible voxel blocks. |
| **Probability & Sensor Model** | Standard log-odds model with static step updates ($\ell_{hit}$, $\ell_{miss}$) along ray paths. | **Continuous B-Spline Depth Fusion (`bfusion`)**: incorporates continuous depth uncertainty models with pre-computed lookup tables (`bspline_lookup`). | Provides smooth probability boundaries around obstacle surfaces and resilience against camera sensor noise. |
| **Downsampling & Scale** | Processes raw depth clouds or requires explicit external voxel grid filtering nodes. | **Integrated Depth Downsampling** (`compute_size_ratio`) directly in the image pipeline before projection. | Configurable tradeoff between spatial detail and compute budget without extra ROS node overhead. |
| **2D Planar Map Generation** | Requires separate nodes (such as `octomap_server`) iterating through tree leaves to project 2D grids. | **Direct Map Projection (`MapManager`)**: projects occupied voxels between configurable z-bounds (`projection_min_z` to `projection_max_z`) directly into standard `nav_msgs/msg/OccupancyGrid`. | Native 2D costmap publishing for Nav2 without auxiliary conversion nodes. |

### Architecture and Data Flow

FastMapping ingests single or multi-camera synchronized depth images and camera intrinsics, looks up camera poses relative to the global map frame via the TF2 buffer, and integrates depth observations into an internal Morton-indexed octree structure using B-spline depth fusion. The integrated volumetric representation is simultaneously published as 3D visual markers for RViz2 and projected into a 2D occupancy grid for navigation stacks such as Nav2.

## Usage

Source the ROS 2 environment before running any nodes:

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
```

### Run with Sample ROS 2 Bag Data

The sample launch file plays pre-recorded sensor data from `/opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/share/bagfiles/spinning` (provided by `ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-bagfile-spinning`) and opens RViz2:

```bash
ros2 launch fast_mapping fast_mapping.launch.py
```

### Run with Intel® RealSense™ Cameras and RTAB-Map

FastMapping supports single and multi-camera configurations with Intel® RealSense™ RGB-D cameras. Multi-camera setups require homogeneous camera models sharing identical intrinsic parameters, with each camera providing a valid `camera_frame <-> map` transformation in the TF tree.

1. Install RTAB-Map ROS dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rtabmap-ros
   ```

2. Launch single-camera mapping with RTAB-Map:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch fast_mapping fast_mapping_rtabmap.launch.py
   ```

3. Launch multi-camera mapping (example using two cameras named `camera_front` and `camera_left`):

   ```bash
   ros2 run fast_mapping fast_mapping_node --ros-args \
       -p depth_cameras:=2 \
       -p depth_topic_1:=camera_front/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw \
       -p depth_topic_2:=camera_left/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw \
       -p depth_info_topic:=camera_front/aligned_depth_to_color/camera_info
   ```

### Run with Custom TF Tree and External Odometry / SLAM

When an external SLAM or odometry module publishes coordinate frames to the TF tree, `fast_mapping_node` queries transformations between the map frame (specified by `map_frame`, default: `map`) and the optical frame specified in the header of the depth image messages (for example, `camera_color_optical_frame`).

1. Launch `fast_mapping_node`:

   ```bash
   ros2 run fast_mapping fast_mapping_node
   ```

2. Play recorded ROS 2 bag data in a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   ros2 bag play <path_to_ros2_bag>
   ```

3. Launch RViz2 for visualization:

   ```bash
   rviz2
   ```

```

### Build for Local Development (Colcon)

To build the ROS 2 packages directly in the workspace using Colcon:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
make build
```

To clean all build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

### Installation

Install the generated Debian package:

```bash
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./build/debian-packages/packages/ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-fast-mapping_*_amd64.deb
